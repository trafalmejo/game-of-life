# Game of Life

This demo represents a celular automata. Conway's Game of Life is a zero-player game determined by its initialstate. In this example the initial state is random.
These are the rules:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2.  Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3.  Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4.  Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell,as if by reproduction.
